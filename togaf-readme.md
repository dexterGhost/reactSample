- **Enterprise**: any collection of organizations that has a common set of goals
- **Architecture**: 
    - A formal description of a system to guide implementation
    - The structure of components, their inter-relationships, and the guidelines governing their design and evolution over time
- Why do we need Enterprise Architecture?
    - Lower costs : development, maintenance, support
    - Reduced complexity
    - Reduced risk
    - Simpler to add new systems
    - Faster purchase and implementation
- Core concepts of Togaf 9.1 standard:
    - Four architecture domains : **BDAT**. BDAT is basically gap analysis for all kinds of architecture.
    - Architecture development method :**ADM**
    - Deliverables, Artifacts, Building blocks
        - Deliverables: work product contractually specified, formally reviewed, agreed to, and signed off on by stakeholders, outputs of projects
        - Artifacts: Architecture work product, catalogs, diagrams, matrices, part of deliverables placed into architecture repository
        - Building blocks: potentially re-usable component (ABB - Architecture building blocks)
    - Enterprise continuum
        - A view of architecture repository
        - Foundation architecture : too generic
        - Common systems architecture : architecture that is common like inventory system
        - Industry architecture :
        - Organization-specific architecture 
    - Architecture repository
        - Similar to filing cabinet
        - Stores deliverables, documents and every architectural outputs at different levels
        - Components (drawers of cabinet):
            - Architecture metamodel: Templates 
            - Architecture capability
            - Architecture landscape
            - Standard information base: External standard documents
            - Reference library
            - Governance log
    - Architecture capability of an organization
        - Capability of a business to support an architecture function
        - Full time architect, a group, who they report to, governance board
- **ADM**
    - Set of 9 steps (Preliminary phase + 8 phases)
    - All phases surround the requirement management phase
    - *In general all BDAT phases end up with conducting a formal stakeholder review and creating architecture document*
    - Phases:
        - Preliminary phase
            - Preparation and initiation activities
            - Defining enterprise (could be just a project within an org)
            - Choosing frameworks (togaf included)
            - Evaluate enterprise maturity and capability
            - Defining the architecture principles and choosing architecture team
        - Architecture Vision (Phase A)
            - Develop a high level vision to be delivered (BA role, requirement gatherings from different teams)
            - Obtain approval for a Statement of Architecture work
            - Define scope
            - Estimate resources needed
            - Develop a roadmap and schedule
            - KPIs and metrics (Cost reduction estimates, less maintainability)
            - Communication plan
        - Business Architecture (Phase B)
            - B in BDAT
            - Develop the baseline business architecture
            - Develop the target business architecture
            - Identify gaps between baseline and target (requirements)
            - Create USE-CASE diagrams
        - Information Systems Architecture (Phase C)
            - D & A in BDAT
            - Develop baseline and target Data and Application architecture
            - Identify gaps
        - Technology Architecture (Phase D)
            - T in BDAT
            - Develop baseline and target Technology architecture
            - Identify gaps
        - Opportunities and Solutions (Phase E)
            - Initial complete version of Architecture Roadmap, based on gap analysis
            - Determine if incremental approach is required
            - Formulate a implementation & migration strategy/plan
            - The architecture vision can be updated as part of Phase E, once you've finalized the design
            - Define SBB’s
        - Migration Planning (Phase F)
            - Finalize Architecture Roadmap and implementation and Migration plan
            - Start implementation, costs, resource requirements
            - Ensuring that plan is coordinated with enterprise’s approach to change
            - Reusable ABB’s
            - Implementation of Governance model
        - Implementation Governance (Phase G)
            - Ensure conformance with target architecture
            - Update baseline architecture as changes are implemented
            - Phase ends when solutions are fully deployed
            - Output is a architecture contract, *a joint agreement between development partners and sponsors on the deliverables, quality and fitness-for-purpose of an architecture*
        - Architecture Change Management (Phase H)
            - Keeping the architecture alive
            - Monitoring changes in the industry, technology changes, formal change requests
            - Execute architecture governance
    - **Enterprise continuum**
        - A view of architecture repository
        - Classifying architecture and solution artifacts
        - Architecture continuum and Solution continuum
        - Basically a tool that allows us to classify artifacts into generic (on left) to specific (on right)
        - ABB’s belong to Architecture continuum
        - SBB’s belong to Solution continuum
        - Continuum from generic to specific below (left to right)
            - Foundation architecture (TRM) —> Common systems architecture(III-RM) —> Industry architecture —> Org-specific architecture

===================================================================================================================

General steps in BDAT (each domain)
- Select Reference, Models, Viewpoints and Tools
    - Modelling (level of detail/modelling)
    - Catalogs
    - Matrices
    - Diagrams
    - Types of requirements
- Develop Baseline architecture description
- Develop Target architecture description
- Perform Gap Analysis
- Identify Candidate roadmap components (like for Technology Architecture domain, roadmaps can be setup dev env, staging env….)
- Resolve impacts (within or outside project scope..)
- Conduct formal stakeholder review
- Finalize architecture
- Create data definition document
